This guide will walk you through the chatbot’s features, how to interact with it, and how to make the most out of its capabilities.

Key Features

Structured Defect Reporting Process The chatbot is built around a straightforward and easy-to-follow 4-step defect reporting process. Here's how it works:
Step 1: Product Identification First, the chatbot will ask for basic details about the product. You'll need to provide information like product name, model, and batch number. This ensures that the defect is linked to the correct item in your inventory.

Step 2: Defect Type The chatbot will then prompt you to select the type of defect you're dealing with. The predefined options cover common defect categories such as:

Material: Issues with the product’s raw materials.

Assembly: Problems that occur during the assembly process.

Packaging: Defects in the packaging of the product.

Other: A custom defect type, if your issue doesn’t fall under any predefined category.

The chatbot makes it easy to quickly choose a defect type from a list or type your own if you have a custom issue.

Step 3: Severity Assessment After you’ve selected the defect type, the chatbot will ask you to assess the severity of the defect. Based on your input, the chatbot will automatically assign a severity level to the defect:

Low: Minor issues that don't affect the product's functionality.

Medium: Issues that affect the product's functionality but don’t render it completely unusable.

High: Critical defects that may prevent the product from working properly or may pose a safety concern.

The chatbot uses your responses to intelligently determine the severity, making it easier for you to categorize defects without ambiguity.

Step 4: Solution Recommendation Once the defect type and severity are identified, the chatbot will present a tailored solution. This solution will be specific to the defect type and its severity level, offering you clear next steps to resolve the issue. It might recommend a fix or point you toward resources or teams that can help.

Visual Progress Tracker Throughout the process, the chatbot will show you where you are in the workflow with a visual progress tracker. This helps keep the process organized and allows you to quickly see how far along you are.

Comprehensive Defect Database The chatbot comes with a comprehensive database of defect types, both predefined and customizable. Here's what it offers:
Predefined Defect Types: These are common categories like Material, Assembly, Packaging, etc. Each category has predefined solutions and severity levels.

Custom Defect Types: If you encounter a defect type that doesn't fit the standard options, you can define your own. The chatbot will still assess its severity and offer a general solution based on the severity level (Low, Medium, High).

Tailored Solutions: The chatbot provides unique solutions for each defect type and severity level. If the defect is minor (low severity), the solution may suggest simple fixes or temporary workarounds. For more severe defects, the chatbot will recommend more immediate and comprehensive actions.

Interactive User Experience To ensure a seamless and interactive experience, the chatbot includes the following features:
Quick Reply Buttons: Instead of typing responses, you can select options directly from a list of buttons. This makes the defect reporting process faster and less prone to error.

Typing Indicators: The chatbot simulates natural conversation flow by displaying typing indicators, so you know it's processing your request and preparing a response.

Color-Coded Severity Indicators: Each defect's severity is clearly displayed using color codes:

Green for Low Severity

Yellow for Medium Severity

Red for High Severity

This color-coding makes it easy for you to visually assess the urgency of a defect.

Clean, Professional Interface: The chatbot has been designed with a user-friendly and professional interface that’s responsive and easy to navigate on both desktop and mobile devices.

Smart Analysis The Smart Analysis feature helps ensure that the defect assessment process is as accurate and efficient as possible:
Automatic Severity Assessment: The chatbot analyzes your responses and determines the severity level based on predefined criteria. This eliminates the need for manual categorization and minimizes the chances of mistakes.

Predefined and Custom Defect Support: Whether you're reporting a common defect or something unique to your production line, the chatbot can handle it. It adapts to both standard defect categories and custom entries.

Tailored Solutions: Based on the severity level of the defect, the chatbot provides you with solutions that fit the situation. If the defect is high-severity, the solution might involve escalating the issue to a supervisor or starting a recall process. For low-severity defects, you might just need to adjust the assembly line or inspect the materials.

Visual Feedback Clear visual feedback helps you track progress and understand your actions:
Severity Feedback: As mentioned, the chatbot uses color-coded indicators to show defect severity (Green for low, Yellow for medium, Red for high), so you can immediately identify how urgent the issue is.

Progress Tracker: At the top of the chat window, a progress bar shows how far you are in the workflow. This helps you stay oriented and ensures that no steps are missed.

Solution Presentation: When a solution is provided, it is formatted in a clear, easy-to-read way, outlining the steps you need to take or recommending who to contact for further assistance.
